# quad-trees
The trees that you will work on in this homework let us search on two-dimensional spaces, and extensions to higher dimensional spaces should be obvious. These kind of trees are very useful in many graphics applications and in computer aided design tools for automated design of VLSI (very large scale integration) circuits. You can reach extra information in homework file.
